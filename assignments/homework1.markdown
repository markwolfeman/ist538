<h1> Homework 1</h1>

- I have [copied 3 pages from a Johnny's Seed catalog](https://www.albany.edu/~mwolfe/ist538/homework/hw1/catalog.pdf). On page 104, mark up in XML item numbers: 2412, 2513, 2671, and 2087 into a well formed XML document. No XML errors are allowed. Consider the rules for writing XML as explained in the readings. Use at least 2 attributes in each of your four tomato seed listings.

Notes about the assignment:
- Pages 105 and 122 list keys to the symbols and codes used in the listed items. Not all symbols used in the tomato seed listings have to be marked up, just demonstrate a few examples of this type of information in your assignment.
- I have OCR'd the PDF so that you can copy and paste the text into your text editor.
- Use attributes sparingly in your XML document. In general, data should be stored in elements, and information about the data (metadata) should be stored in an attribute.
- There are many ways to mark up the information, though there are certain approaches that are more logical than others.
- All questions regarding homeworks should be submitted to the appropriate discussion forum.
- This assignment is worth 10 points.
