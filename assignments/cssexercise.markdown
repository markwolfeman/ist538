<h2>CSS Exercise</h2>

- Download the .xsl file and the .xml file and create a new  .css file. They all need to &ldquo;live&rdquo; in the same folder. Take the XSL file and  remove all of the HTML styling and replace it with CSS styling. You are going  to create a separate CSS file that will be referenced by your .xsl file. Make these visual enhancements using CSS, but you will also have to update your  .xsl file in places where <span style="font-family:Courier">class</span> and <span style="font-family:Courier">id</span> selectors are used. Create comments for  all of your CSS statements. In order to test your CSS, you will &ldquo;run&rdquo; the file  from  your .xml file.</p>

- You need to set up your .xsl file to link out to an external .css file.</li>

<span style="font-family:Courier">table</span>

- Define the <span style="font-family:Courier">border width (900px)</span> and <span style="font-family:Courier">height (100px)</span>

- <span style="font-family:Courier">th </span>and <span style="font-family:Courier">tr</span>
- Define a <span style="font-family:Courier">div</span> that will create a background box under the <span style="font-family:Courier">table</span>, change the color to <span style="font-family:Courier">light green</span>, and make it just stick out around the edges of the table. Here’s some code to get you going:

    <span style="font-family:Courier"> div
       {
          width: 9500px;<br />
          height: 200px;<br />
          background-color: yellow;<br />
          box-shadow: 10px 10px 5px #888888;<br />
        }</span>
     
- Using an <span style="font-family:Courier">id</span> selector, create an <span style="font-family:Courier">id</span> for the top <span style="font-family:Courier">p</span> tags, such as “<span style="font-family:Courier">para1</span>” and “<span style="font-family:Courier">para2</span>”. Center the <span style="font-family:Courier">p</span> tag, and pick a color and make the text bold or italics etc.


- Apply a shadow to it using<span style="font-family:Courier"> text-shadow: 2px 2px;</span>
- Make the text bold using  <span style="font-family:Courier">font-weight: bold;</span>
