I've posted Unit 5 and Homework 2.

[Homework 2 is here.](https://markwolfeman.github.io/ist538/assignments/homework2.html)

It's due this Saturday 7/4, but I would try to complete it sooner, because you've got an exercise using XMLSchema that I will release tomorrow.

Unit 5 is all about XML Schema, which is totally different from DTD's, so I would focus on Homework 2 first, and then proceed to Unit 5.
