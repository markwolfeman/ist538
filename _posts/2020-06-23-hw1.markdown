Hi All,

I've released Homework 1, which is due this Sunday. 

I've created an "Assignments" page at the top of the course site. The Homework assignment will also be found on the calendar.

Just so you know, some of the instructional videos have a slight mis-match between the old site colors and the new ones. 

I've also created a Homework 1 discussion forum. Please feel free to ask and answer questions there. I will chime in too. Please, don't hand out solutions to homeworks wholesale, but code snippets etc. are fine and how we work in the real world.
