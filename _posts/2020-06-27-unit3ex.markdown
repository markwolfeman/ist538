I've released Unit 3, which delves into the topic of DTDs. The technology is relatively easy to code, but the debugging and validating can be tricky.

For the exercise, be sure to use the validators, and try to do the project piece by piece. Work in groups or work alone. Do the readings, videos, and take a look at the online validators before proceeding to the exercise.

**Due on Monday, 6/29.**

Collaborate on the "Unit 3 exercise discussion" board, when finished please post a "completed" version of it. Each of you need to post your completed version. 

Have a great weekend!
