Hi All,

I've released Unit 7 please start readings and videos soon!

I will release Test 1 probably tomorrow and you will have plenty of time for you all to complete it. If for some reason you need it to be available past Wednesday, just let me know.

Here's the format and types of questions on the test:

    True/false: You will be asked to determine if code is well formed or not well-formed
    Complete the code: Fill in the blank, you will be given hints
    Multiple choice:  Complete the code or affirm what the code does
    Time:  120 minutes, and once you start the exam, you must complete it in one sitting.


Test availability:

    Opens Sunday, July 12th (will announce)
    Closes Wedneday, July  15th at 11:59pm.


The test is valued at 30 points, but there are 32 possible points, in which to reach 30. In other words, you get a chance to score 2 points of extra credit.  After you complete the test, I will report back to you over email individually your grade. There are fill in the blank questions that Blackboard cannot grade, and you should note that I do not use the Blackboard grade book. I’ve created a "Test 1 Review" forum for questions related to the exam. 

Review: 

    Know the parts of an element.
    Know the concept fundamentals of XML, DTD, XML Schema. Just the fundamentals, not stuff we never discussed in videos or used in homeworks or exercises. 
    Know the code fundamentals of XML, DTD, XML Schema. You will use this to do fill in the blank, complete the code questions.
    This will be limited to code we did in exercises and homework—no curveballs here. For example, how might you define a sequence in DTD? 
    You will be asked to identify whether or not a code fragment is legal/well-formed XML. 
    Know the parts of an XML document
