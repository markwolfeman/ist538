Hi All,

Welcome to IST 538! While I know the first day of this Summer session does not start until Monday, I thought I would release the course now so you can get a head start. 

[Unit 1 is now available on the course site:](https://markwolfeman.github.io/ist538/calendar/) 

After you watch the videos and powerpoint presentation, you will have two tasks to work through, both due 6/23.

Also, the readings are set for Unit 2. 

Again, welcome! Feel free to post any questions you have to the discussion board's "Ask A Question"

-Mark
