# Software & Technology

Students must have access to a computer and a high-speed Internet connection, and a technology back-up plan in order to take the course. 

We will use [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads/) for editing XML documents, which is only for Windows users. If you use Mac or Windows, [XMLSpear](http://www.donkeydevelopment.com/) is a good XML text editor. 
Later in the course we will use the software [BaseX](http://basex.org/) to edit and process XQuery statements. These applications will be featured in video tutorials. If you are using your own computer, you will need to install a version yourself. 
In addition to installing Notepad++, you must add a plugin called XML Tools to enhance our productivity when working with XML documents. For the XQuery module part of the course, we will use BaseX to process our code. 

# Readings

The textbook readings present technical aspects of XML. The majority of the supplementary readings explore topical issues related to XML and the information professions. Complete assigned readings before viewing course videos or presentations. The videos, presentations, and exercises are presented with the assumption that you have completed the assigned readings. While the textbook chapters are short, they may require multiple readings in order to make sense of the concepts and technologies. You will increase the speed in which you master the material by working through the textbook examples using your XML editor. Rather than typing all of the examples from the textbook by hand, you may download them from the author's [Kevin Goldberg's website](http://www.kehogo.com/examples).

# Unit modules 

The first "day" of class is **Monday, June 22nd**, and commences with Unit 1. Each subsequent Unit will be started on the date following the Unit number. You should have completed all learning materials (readings, videos etc.) before the next unit begins, the earlier the better. 

# Announcements

I use Blackboard's announcements tool to release course material, course additions or changes, due date extensions, and other important information. Please check your email or Blackboard regularly for this information. 

# Discussion Forum

We will use [Blackboard's Discussion tool](https://blackboard.albany.edu/webapps/blackboard/execute/announcement?method=search&context=course&course_id=_124658_1&handle=cp_announcements&mode=cpview). All questions, comments, and useful information for fellow students and the instructor should be posted to the Discussion Forum. Please do not send me email, except for issues of a personal nature. All homework, test, and project questions will be asked and answered via the discussion tool. If no group work is assigned for that Unit, then the expectation is that you provide helpful answers to your classmates via the forum for "Group Exercises and Discussion" credit. If you know the solution, then please do not merely post the entire code or file. 

# Netiquette

We will use the rules and best practices associated with [*netiquette*](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/netiquette). Because this is an online course, we will be relying solely on written communication over the Internet to ask and answer questions, and in general, to complete the course successfully. Our motto must be:  “Think before you post.” Please take a look at this [resource](http://learning.colostate.edu/guides/guide.cfm?guideid=4) for best practices and rules of thumb for Internet etiquette. 

# Homeworks & Final Project

To excel in this class, students must demonstrate the ability to use various web technologies. Hand in assignments on time! Contact me if you cannot meet a deadline, if not, I will mark assignment as a zero. Additionally, students who fall behind will most likely suffer on the following assignments and tests, and ultimately their final grade. You should devote 8-10 hours per unit to the course.

# Tests

You will take two tests. Each will be adminstered via Blackboard.

# Submission Process

Submit all assignments as an attachment in an email. Homework submissions to the instructor should include a subject heading like the following, "IST 538 / Homework 1 submission." The majority of the assignments must be submitted as an archived file using the .zip format so as not to be deemed a virus by Outlook. I will return your homework via email graded. Group exercises will be submitted to the discussion board.

# Tips for Online Learning

Because this is an online class, you will experience lots of flexibility in how you manage your time. But, with that flexibility comes reponsibility, and vigilance of staying on track. There are no face to face cues that you normally recieve in a convential class. Please login to Blackboard regularly to stay up to date of current announcments or needed answers to discussion board questions. 

# Disability Support

Reasonable accommodations will be provided for students with documented physical, sensory, systemic, cognitive, learning and psychiatric disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring accommodation in this class, please notify the Director of the Disability Resource Center (Campus Center 137, 442-5490). That office will provide the course instructor with verification of your disability, and will recommend appropriate accommodations.

# Academic Integrity

The class follows the University's policy on [Academic Integrity](http://www.albany.edu/studentconduct/standards_of_academic_integrity.php).
